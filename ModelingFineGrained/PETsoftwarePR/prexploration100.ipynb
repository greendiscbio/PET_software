    "The basic idea behind this approach is that we can use the PET data available in our database to develop automatic causal rules. These are of three types:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Absolute rules**: *'if region A is hypometabolic/non-hypometabolic, region B is hypometabolic/non-hypometabolic with a probability p'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We ilustrate it with the example *'if region A is hypometabolic, then region B is hypometabolic with a probability p'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We calculate the number of patients in which region A is hypometabolic.\n",
    "2. We calculate the number of patients in which region B is hypometabolic, being region A hypometabolic.\n",
    "3. We divide both quantities to obtain the probability of region B being hypometabolic when region A is hypometabolic.\n",
    "4. If this probability is above a given threshold, we generate the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalised rules**: they are similar to the absolute rules but normalise the probabilities so to outline real relations and discard noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We ilustrate it with the example *'if region A is hypometabolic, then region B is hypometabolic with a probability p'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We calculate the number of patients in which region A is hypometabolic.\n",
    "2. We calculate the number of patients in which region B is hypometabolic, being region A hypometabolic.\n",
    "3. We calculate the number of patients in which region B is hypometabolic, being region A non-hypometabolic.\n",
    "4. We substract quantity 3 to quantity 2 to obtain a normalised count of region B being hypometabolic when region A is hypometabolic.\n",
    "5. We divide quantity 4 with quantity 1 to obtain the normalised probability of region B being hypometabolic when region A is hypometabolic.\n",
    "6. If this probability is above a given threshold, we generate the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relative rules**: *'region A and region B have equal/unequal metabolism with a probability p'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We ilustrate it with the example *'region A and region B have equal metabolism with a probability p'*.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We calculate the number of patients\n",
    "2. We calculate the number of patients in which region A has the same metabolism as region B.\n",
    "3. We divide both quantities to obtain the probabilitiy of region A having the same metabolism as region B.\n",
    "4. If this probability is above a given threshold, we generate the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules can be defined with two different strategies: **'non-hierarchical'** means that we look for relations between all regions; **'hierarchical'** means that we only look for relations between one region and those with lower hierarchy. For example, if we are looking for hypometabolism-hypometabolism relations, we only define rules from more hypometabolic regions to less hypometabolic regions. In this way, we try to follow the logic behind the disease. When considering normalised rules, there is not much difference between using one or another strategy."

    "The development of these rules gives a lot of information that might be of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we notice is that the **relations of equivalence (both regions have the same metabolism) are much more remarkable than the relations of unequivalence (each region has a different metabolism)**. This makes sense since no disease would increase the metabolism of a region while decreasing that of another one. Although the most probable relations are those between non-hypometabolism and non-hypometabolism, **we are more interested in the relations between hypometabolism and hypometabolism as they are probably related with the expansion of the disease**. Therefore, conclusions will only be related with this type of relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing we notice is that **relations are more abundant when we isolate patients of the same condition**. When all of them are together, very few patterns remain. When they are separated, the patterns characteristic from each condition arise. This demonstrates that each condition has its own particular relations between brain regions. "
